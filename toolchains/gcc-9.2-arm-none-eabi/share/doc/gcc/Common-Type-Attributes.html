<h4 class="subsection">6.35.1 Common Type Attributes</h4>

<p>The following type attributes are supported on most targets.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007baligned_007d-type-attribute-3990"></a>
<dl><dt><code>aligned</code><dt><code>aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd>The <code>aligned</code> attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for
variables of the specified type.  When specified, <var>alignment</var> must be
a power of 2.  Specifying no <var>alignment</var> argument implies the maximum
alignment for the target, which is often, but by no means always, 8 or 16
bytes.  For example, the declarations:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct __attribute__ ((aligned (8))) S { short f[3]; };
          typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">force the compiler to ensure (as far as it can) that each variable whose
type is <code>struct S</code> or <code>more_aligned_int</code> is allocated and
aligned <em>at least</em> on a 8-byte boundary.  On a SPARC, having all
variables of type <code>struct S</code> aligned to 8-byte boundaries allows
the compiler to use the <code>ldd</code> and <code>std</code> (doubleword load and
store) instructions when copying one variable of type <code>struct S</code> to
another, thus improving run-time efficiency.

     <p>Note that the alignment of any given <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type
is required by the ISO C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of
the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members of
the <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> in question.  This means that you <em>can</em>
effectively adjust the alignment of a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>
type by attaching an <code>aligned</code> attribute to any one of the members
of such a type, but the notation illustrated in the example above is a
more obvious, intuitive, and readable way to request the compiler to
adjust the alignment of an entire <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type.

     <p>As in the preceding example, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given <code>struct</code>
or <code>union</code> type.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a type to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct __attribute__ ((aligned)) S { short f[3]; };
</pre>
     <p>Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <code>aligned</code>
attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment
for the type to the largest alignment that is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often
make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use
whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing
copies to or from the variables that have types that you have aligned
this way.

     <p>In the example above, if the size of each <code>short</code> is 2 bytes, then
the size of the entire <code>struct S</code> type is 6 bytes.  The smallest
power of two that is greater than or equal to that is 8, so the
compiler sets the alignment for the entire <code>struct S</code> type to 8
bytes.

     <p>Note that although you can ask the compiler to select a time-efficient
alignment for a given type and then declare only individual stand-alone
objects of that type, the compiler's ability to select a time-efficient
alignment is primarily useful only when you plan to create arrays of
variables having the relevant (efficiently aligned) type.  If you
declare or use arrays of variables of an efficiently-aligned type, then
it is likely that your program also does pointer arithmetic (or
subscripting, which amounts to the same thing) on pointers to the
relevant type, and the code that the compiler generates for these
pointer arithmetic operations is often more efficient for
efficiently-aligned types than for other types.

     <p>Note that the effectiveness of <code>aligned</code> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8-byte alignment, then specifying <code>aligned (16)</code>
in an <code>__attribute__</code> still only provides you with 8-byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

     <p>When used on a struct, or struct member, the <code>aligned</code> attribute can
only increase the alignment; in order to decrease it, the <code>packed</code>
attribute must be specified as well.  When used as part of a typedef, the
<code>aligned</code> attribute can both increase and decrease alignment, and
specifying the <code>packed</code> attribute generates a warning.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bwarn_005fif_005fnot_005faligned_007d-type-attribute-3991"></a><br><dt><code>warn_if_not_aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd>This attribute specifies a threshold for the structure field, measured
in bytes.  If the structure field is aligned below the threshold, a
warning will be issued.  For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef unsigned long long __u64
             __attribute__((aligned (4), warn_if_not_aligned (8)));
          
          struct foo
          {
            int i1;
            int i2;
            __u64 x;
          };
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to issue an warning on <code>struct foo</code>, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning: alignment 4 of 'struct foo' is less than 8</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
It is used to define <code>struct foo</code> in such a way that
<code>struct foo</code> has the same layout and the structure field <code>x</code>
has the same alignment when <code>__u64</code> is aligned at either 4 or
8 bytes.  Align <code>struct foo</code> to 8 bytes:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct __attribute__ ((aligned (8))) foo
          {
            int i1;
            int i2;
            __u64 x;
          };
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">silences the warning.  The compiler also issues a warning, like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">warning: 'x' offset 12 in 'struct foo' isn't aligned to 8</span></samp>&rsquo;,
when the structure field has the misaligned offset:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct __attribute__ ((aligned (8))) foo
          {
            int i1;
            int i2;
            int i3;
            __u64 x;
          };
</pre>
     <p>This warning can be disabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wno-if-not-aligned</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>alloc_size (</code><var>position</var><code>)</code><dt><code>alloc_size (</code><var>position-1</var><code>, </code><var>position-2</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007balloc_005fsize_007d-type-attribute-3992"></a>The <code>alloc_size</code> type attribute may be applied to the definition
of a type of a function that returns a pointer and takes at least one
argument of an integer type.  It indicates that the returned pointer
points to an object whose size is given by the function argument at
<var>position-1</var>, or by the product of the arguments at <var>position-1</var>
and <var>position-2</var>.  Meaningful sizes are positive values less than
<code>PTRDIFF_MAX</code>.  Other sizes are disagnosed when detected.  GCC uses
this information to improve the results of <code>__builtin_object_size</code>.

     <p>For instance, the following declarations

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef __attribute__ ((alloc_size (1, 2))) void*
            calloc_type (size_t, size_t);
          typedef __attribute__ ((alloc_size (1))) void*
            malloc_type (size_t);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">specify that <code>calloc_type</code> is a type of a function that, like
the standard C function <code>calloc</code>, returns an object whose size
is given by the product of arguments 1 and 2, and that
<code>malloc_type</code>, like the standard C function <code>malloc</code>,
returns an object whose size is given by argument 1 to the function.

     <br><dt><code>copy</code><dt><code>copy (</code><var>expression</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcopy_007d-type-attribute-3993"></a>The <code>copy</code> attribute applies the set of attributes with which
the type of the <var>expression</var> has been declared to the declaration
of the type to which the attribute is applied.  The attribute is
designed for libraries that define aliases that are expected to
specify the same set of attributes as the aliased symbols. 
The <code>copy</code> attribute can be used with types, variables, or
functions.  However, the kind of symbol to which the attribute is
applied (either varible or function) must match the kind of symbol
to which the argument refers. 
The <code>copy</code> attribute copies only syntactic and semantic attributes
but not attributes that affect a symbol's linkage or visibility such as
<code>alias</code>, <code>visibility</code>, or <code>weak</code>.  The <code>deprecated</code>
attribute is also not copied.  See <a href="Common-Function-Attributes.html#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>. 
See <a href="Common-Variable-Attributes.html#Common-Variable-Attributes">Common Variable Attributes</a>.

     <p>For example, suppose <code>struct A</code> below is defined in some third
party library header to have the alignment requirement <code>N</code> and
to force a warning whenever a variable of the type is not so aligned
due to attribute <code>packed</code>.  Specifying the <code>copy</code> attribute
on the definition on the unrelated <code>struct B</code> has the effect of
copying all relevant attributes from the type referenced by the pointer
expression to <code>struct B</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct __attribute__ ((aligned (N), warn_if_not_aligned (N)))
          A { /* <span class="roman">...</span> */ };
          struct __attribute__ ((copy ( (struct A *)0)) B { /* <span class="roman">...</span> */ };
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>deprecated</code><dt><code>deprecated (</code><var>msg</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdeprecated_007d-type-attribute-3994"></a>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute results in a warning if the type
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
types that are expected to be removed in a future version of a program. 
If possible, the warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated type, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the type is deprecated, or what they should do
instead.  Note that the warnings only occur for uses and then only
if the type is being applied to an identifier that itself is not being
declared as deprecated.

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int T1 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          T1 x;
          typedef T1 T2;
          T2 y;
          typedef T1 T3 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          T3 z __attribute__ ((deprecated));
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">results in a warning on line 2 and 3 but not lines 4, 5, or 6.  No
warning is issued for line 4 because T2 is not explicitly
deprecated.  Line 5 has no warning because T3 is explicitly
deprecated.  Similarly for line 6.  The optional <var>msg</var>
argument, which must be a string, is printed in the warning if
present.  Control characters in the string will be replaced with
escape sequences, and if the <samp><span class="option">-fmessage-length</span></samp> option is set
to 0 (its default value) then any newline characters will be ignored.

     <p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be used for functions and
variables (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>, see <a href="Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>.)

     <p>The message attached to the attribute is affected by the setting of
the <samp><span class="option">-fmessage-length</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>designated_init</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdesignated_005finit_007d-type-attribute-3995"></a>This attribute may only be applied to structure types.  It indicates
that any initialization of an object of this type must use designated
initializers rather than positional initializers.  The intent of this
attribute is to allow the programmer to indicate that a structure's
layout may change, and that therefore relying on positional
initialization will result in future breakage.

     <p>GCC emits warnings based on this attribute by default; use
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-designated-init</span></samp> to suppress them.

     <br><dt><code>may_alias</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmay_005falias_007d-type-attribute-3996"></a>Accesses through pointers to types with this attribute are not subject
to type-based alias analysis, but are instead assumed to be able to alias
any other type of objects. 
In the context of section 6.5 paragraph 7 of the C99 standard,
an lvalue expression
dereferencing such a pointer is treated like having a character type. 
See <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp> for more information on aliasing issues. 
This extension exists to support some vector APIs, in which pointers to
one vector type are permitted to alias pointers to a different vector type.

     <p>Note that an object of a type with this attribute does not have any
special semantics.

     <p>Example of use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef short __attribute__ ((__may_alias__)) short_a;
          
          int
          main (void)
          {
            int a = 0x12345678;
            short_a *b = (short_a *) &amp;a;
          
            b[1] = 0;
          
            if (a == 0x12345678)
              abort();
          
            exit(0);
          }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If you replaced <code>short_a</code> with <code>short</code> in the variable
declaration, the above program would abort when compiled with
<samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp>, which is on by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> or
above.

     <br><dt><code>mode (</code><var>mode</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmode_007d-type-attribute-3997"></a>This attribute specifies the data type for the declaration&mdash;whichever
type corresponds to the mode <var>mode</var>.  This in effect lets you
request an integer or floating-point type according to its width.

     <p>See <a href="../gccint/Machine-Modes.html#Machine-Modes">Machine Modes</a>,
for a list of the possible keywords for <var>mode</var>. 
You may also specify a mode of <code>byte</code> or <code>__byte__</code> to
indicate the mode corresponding to a one-byte integer, <code>word</code> or
<code>__word__</code> for the mode of a one-word integer, and <code>pointer</code>
or <code>__pointer__</code> for the mode used to represent pointers.

     <br><dt><code>packed</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bpacked_007d-type-attribute-3998"></a>This attribute, attached to a <code>struct</code>, <code>union</code>, or C++ <code>class</code>
type definition, specifies that each of its members (other than zero-width
bit-fields) is placed to minimize the memory required.  This is equivalent
to specifying the <code>packed</code> attribute on each of the members.

     <p><a name="index-fshort_002denums-3999"></a>When attached to an <code>enum</code> definition, the <code>packed</code> attribute
indicates that the smallest integral type should be used. 
Specifying the <samp><span class="option">-fshort-enums</span></samp> flag on the command line
is equivalent to specifying the <code>packed</code>
attribute on all <code>enum</code> definitions.

     <p>In the following example <code>struct my_packed_struct</code>'s members are
packed closely together, but the internal layout of its <code>s</code> member
is not packed&mdash;to do that, <code>struct my_unpacked_struct</code> needs to
be packed too.

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct my_unpacked_struct
           {
              char c;
              int i;
           };
          
          struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) my_packed_struct
            {
               char c;
               int  i;
               struct my_unpacked_struct s;
            };
</pre>
     <p>You may only specify the <code>packed</code> attribute on the definition
of an <code>enum</code>, <code>struct</code>, <code>union</code>, or <code>class</code>,
not on a <code>typedef</code> that does not also define the enumerated type,
structure, union, or class.

     <br><dt><code>scalar_storage_order ("</code><var>endianness</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bscalar_005fstorage_005forder_007d-type-attribute-4000"></a>When attached to a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code>, this attribute sets
the storage order, aka endianness, of the scalar fields of the type, as
well as the array fields whose component is scalar.  The supported
endiannesses are <code>big-endian</code> and <code>little-endian</code>.  The attribute
has no effects on fields which are themselves a <code>union</code>, a <code>struct</code>
or an array whose component is a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code>, and it is
possible for these fields to have a different scalar storage order than the
enclosing type.

     <p>This attribute is supported only for targets that use a uniform default
scalar storage order (fortunately, most of them), i.e. targets that store
the scalars either all in big-endian or all in little-endian.

     <p>Additional restrictions are enforced for types with the reverse scalar
storage order with regard to the scalar storage order of the target:

          <ul>
<li>Taking the address of a scalar field of a <code>union</code> or a
<code>struct</code> with reverse scalar storage order is not permitted and yields
an error. 
<li>Taking the address of an array field, whose component is scalar, of
a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code> with reverse scalar storage order is
permitted but yields a warning, unless <samp><span class="option">-Wno-scalar-storage-order</span></samp>
is specified. 
<li>Taking the address of a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code> with reverse
scalar storage order is permitted. 
</ul>

     <p>These restrictions exist because the storage order attribute is lost when
the address of a scalar or the address of an array with scalar component is
taken, so storing indirectly through this address generally does not work. 
The second case is nevertheless allowed to be able to perform a block copy
from or to the array.

     <p>Moreover, the use of type punning or aliasing to toggle the storage order
is not supported; that is to say, a given scalar object cannot be accessed
through distinct types that assign a different storage order to it.

     <br><dt><code>transparent_union</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007btransparent_005funion_007d-type-attribute-4001"></a>
This attribute, attached to a <code>union</code> type definition, indicates
that any function parameter having that union type causes calls to that
function to be treated in a special way.

     <p>First, the argument corresponding to a transparent union type can be of
any type in the union; no cast is required.  Also, if the union contains
a pointer type, the corresponding argument can be a null pointer
constant or a void pointer expression; and if the union contains a void
pointer type, the corresponding argument can be any pointer expression. 
If the union member type is a pointer, qualifiers like <code>const</code> on
the referenced type must be respected, just as with normal pointer
conversions.

     <p>Second, the argument is passed to the function using the calling
conventions of the first member of the transparent union, not the calling
conventions of the union itself.  All members of the union must have the
same machine representation; this is necessary for this argument passing
to work properly.

     <p>Transparent unions are designed for library functions that have multiple
interfaces for compatibility reasons.  For example, suppose the
<code>wait</code> function must accept either a value of type <code>int *</code> to
comply with POSIX, or a value of type <code>union wait *</code> to comply with
the 4.1BSD interface.  If <code>wait</code>'s parameter were <code>void *</code>,
<code>wait</code> would accept both kinds of arguments, but it would also
accept any other pointer type and this would make argument type checking
less useful.  Instead, <code>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</code> might define the interface
as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef union __attribute__ ((__transparent_union__))
            {
              int *__ip;
              union wait *__up;
            } wait_status_ptr_t;
          
          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This interface allows either <code>int *</code> or <code>union wait *</code>
arguments to be passed, using the <code>int *</code> calling convention. 
The program can call <code>wait</code> with arguments of either type:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int w1 () { int w; return wait (&amp;w); }
          int w2 () { union wait w; return wait (&amp;w); }
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">With this interface, <code>wait</code>'s implementation might look like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t p)
          {
            return waitpid (-1, p.__ip, 0);
          }
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>unused</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bunused_007d-type-attribute-4002"></a>When attached to a type (including a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code>),
this attribute means that variables of that type are meant to appear
possibly unused.  GCC does not produce a warning for any variables of
that type, even if the variable appears to do nothing.  This is often
the case with lock or thread classes, which are usually defined and then
not referenced, but contain constructors and destructors that have
nontrivial bookkeeping functions.

     <br><dt><code>vector_size (</code><var>bytes</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvector_005fsize_007d-type-attribute-4003"></a>This attribute specifies the vector size for the type, measured in bytes. 
The type to which it applies is known as the <dfn>base type</dfn>.  The <var>bytes</var>
argument must be a positive power-of-two multiple of the base type size.  For
example, the following declarations:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef __attribute__ ((vector_size (32))) int int_vec32_t ;
          typedef __attribute__ ((vector_size (32))) int* int_vec32_ptr_t;
          typedef __attribute__ ((vector_size (32))) int int_vec32_arr3_t[3];
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">define <code>int_vec32_t</code> to be a 32-byte vector type composed of <code>int</code>
sized units.  With <code>int</code> having a size of 4 bytes, the type defines
a vector of eight units, four bytes each.  The mode of variables of type
<code>int_vec32_t</code> is <code>V8SI</code>.  <code>int_vec32_ptr_t</code> is then defined
to be a pointer to such a vector type, and <code>int_vec32_arr3_t</code> to be
an array of three such vectors.  See <a href="Vector-Extensions.html#Vector-Extensions">Vector Extensions</a> for details of
manipulating objects of vector types.

     <p>This attribute is only applicable to integral and floating scalar types. 
In function declarations the attribute applies to the function return
type.

     <p>For example, the following:
     <pre class="smallexample">          __attribute__ ((vector_size (16))) float get_flt_vec16 (void);
</pre>
     <p>declares <code>get_flt_vec16</code> to be a function returning a 16-byte vector
with the base type <code>float</code>.

     <br><dt><code>visibility</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvisibility_007d-type-attribute-4004"></a>In C++, attribute visibility (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>) can also be
applied to class, struct, union and enum types.  Unlike other type
attributes, the attribute must appear between the initial keyword and
the name of the type; it cannot appear after the body of the type.

     <p>Note that the type visibility is applied to vague linkage entities
associated with the class (vtable, typeinfo node, etc.).  In
particular, if a class is thrown as an exception in one shared object
and caught in another, the class must have default visibility. 
Otherwise the two shared objects are unable to use the same
typeinfo node and exception handling will break.

 <p>To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
double parentheses: for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
packed))</span></samp>&rsquo;.
