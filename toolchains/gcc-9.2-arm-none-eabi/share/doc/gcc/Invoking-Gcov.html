<h3 class="section">10.2 Invoking <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp></h3>

<pre class="smallexample">     gcov <span class="roman">[</span><var>options</var><span class="roman">]</span> <var>files</var>
</pre>
 <p><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> accepts the following options:

<!-- man begin OPTIONS -->
     <dl>
<dt><code>-a</code><dt><code>--all-blocks</code><dd>Write individual execution counts for every basic block.  Normally gcov
outputs execution counts only for the main blocks of a line.  With this
option you can determine if blocks within a single line are not being
executed.

     <br><dt><code>-b</code><dt><code>--branch-probabilities</code><dd>Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch summary
info to the standard output.  This option allows you to see how often
each branch in your program was taken.  Unconditional branches will not
be shown, unless the <samp><span class="option">-u</span></samp> option is given.

     <br><dt><code>-c</code><dt><code>--branch-counts</code><dd>Write branch frequencies as the number of branches taken, rather than
the percentage of branches taken.

     <br><dt><code>-d</code><dt><code>--display-progress</code><dd>Display the progress on the standard output.

     <br><dt><code>-f</code><dt><code>--function-summaries</code><dd>Output summaries for each function in addition to the file level summary.

     <br><dt><code>-h</code><dt><code>--help</code><dd>Display help about using <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> (on the standard output), and
exit without doing any further processing.

     <br><dt><code>-i</code><dt><code>--json-format</code><dd>Output gcov file in an easy-to-parse JSON intermediate format
which does not require source code for generation.  The JSON
file is compressed with gzip compression algorithm
and the files have <samp><span class="file">.gcov.json.gz</span></samp> extension.

     <p>Structure of the JSON is following:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            "current_working_directory": <var>current_working_directory</var>,
            "data_file": <var>data_file</var>,

            "gcc_version": <var>gcc_version</var>
            "files": [<var>file</var>]
          }
</pre>
     <p>Fields of the root element have following semantics:

          <ul>
<li><var>current_working_directory</var>: working directory where
a compilation unit was compiled

          <li><var>data_file</var>: name of the data file (GCDA)

          <li><var>format_version</var>: semantic version of the format

          <li><var>gcc_version</var>: version of the GCC compiler
</ul>

     <p>Each <var>file</var> has the following form:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            "file": <var>file_name</var>,
            "functions": [<var>function</var>],
            "lines": [<var>line</var>]
          }
</pre>
     <p>Fields of the <var>file</var> element have following semantics:

          <ul>
<li><var>file_name</var>: name of the source file
</ul>

     <p>Each <var>function</var> has the following form:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            "blocks": <var>blocks</var>,
            "blocks_executed": <var>blocks_executed</var>,

            "start_column": <var>start_column</var>
            "start_line": <var>start_line</var>
          }
</pre>
     <p>Fields of the <var>function</var> element have following semantics:

          <ul>
<li><var>blocks</var>: number of blocks that are in the function

          <li><var>blocks_executed</var>: number of executed blocks of the function

          <li><var>demangled_name</var>: demangled name of the function

          <li><var>end_column</var>: column in the source file where the function ends

          <li><var>end_line</var>: line in the source file where the function ends

          <li><var>execution_count</var>: number of executions of the function

          <li><var>name</var>: name of the function

          <li><var>start_column</var>: column in the source file where the function begins

          <li><var>start_line</var>: line in the source file where the function begins
</ul>

     <p>Note that line numbers and column numbers number from 1.  In the current
implementation, <var>start_line</var> and <var>start_column</var> do not include
any template parameters and the leading return type but that
this is likely to be fixed in the future.

     <p>Each <var>line</var> has the following form:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            "branches": [<var>branch</var>],
            "count": <var>count</var>,

            "function_name": <var>function_name</var>,
          }
</pre>
     <p>Branches are present only with <var>-b</var> option. 
Fields of the <var>line</var> element have following semantics:

          <ul>
<li><var>count</var>: number of executions of the line

          <li><var>line_number</var>: line number

          <li><var>unexecuted_block</var>: flag whether the line contains an unexecuted block
(not all statements on the line are executed)

          <li><var>function_name</var>: a name of a function this <var>line</var> belongs to
(for a line with an inlined statements can be not set)
</ul>

     <p>Each <var>branch</var> has the following form:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            "count": <var>count</var>,
            "fallthrough": <var>fallthrough</var>,
            "throw": <var>throw</var>
          }
</pre>
     <p>Fields of the <var>branch</var> element have following semantics:

          <ul>
<li><var>count</var>: number of executions of the branch

          <li><var>fallthrough</var>: true when the branch is a fall through branch

          <li><var>throw</var>: true when the branch is an exceptional branch
</ul>

     <br><dt><code>-j</code><dt><code>--human-readable</code><dd>Write counts in human readable format (like 24.6k).

     <br><dt><code>-k</code><dt><code>--use-colors</code><dd>
Use colors for lines of code that have zero coverage.  We use red color for
non-exceptional lines and cyan for exceptional.  Same colors are used for
basic blocks with <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-l</code><dt><code>--long-file-names</code><dd>Create long file names for included source files.  For example, if the
header file <samp><span class="file">x.h</span></samp> contains code, and was included in the file
<samp><span class="file">a.c</span></samp>, then running <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> on the file <samp><span class="file">a.c</span></samp> will
produce an output file called <samp><span class="file">a.c##x.h.gcov</span></samp> instead of
<samp><span class="file">x.h.gcov</span></samp>.  This can be useful if <samp><span class="file">x.h</span></samp> is included in
multiple source files and you want to see the individual
contributions.  If you use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; option, both the including
and included file names will be complete path names.

     <br><dt><code>-m</code><dt><code>--demangled-names</code><dd>Display demangled function names in output. The default is to show
mangled function names.

     <br><dt><code>-n</code><dt><code>--no-output</code><dd>Do not create the <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> output file.

     <br><dt><code>-o </code><var>directory|file</var><dt><code>--object-directory </code><var>directory</var><dt><code>--object-file </code><var>file</var><dd>Specify either the directory containing the gcov data files, or the
object path name.  The <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> data files are searched for using this option.  If a directory
is specified, the data files are in that directory and named after the
input file name, without its extension.  If a file is specified here,
the data files are named after that file, without its extension.

     <br><dt><code>-p</code><dt><code>--preserve-paths</code><dd>Preserve complete path information in the names of generated
<samp><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> files.  Without this option, just the filename component is
used.  With this option, all directories are used, with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; characters
translated to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> directory components
removed and unremoveable <samp><span class="file">..</span></samp>
components renamed to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is useful if sourcefiles are in several
different directories.

     <br><dt><code>-q</code><dt><code>--use-hotness-colors</code><dd>
Emit perf-like colored output for hot lines.  Legend of the color scale
is printed at the very beginning of the output file.

     <br><dt><code>-r</code><dt><code>--relative-only</code><dd>Only output information about source files with a relative pathname
(after source prefix elision).  Absolute paths are usually system
header files and coverage of any inline functions therein is normally
uninteresting.

     <br><dt><code>-s </code><var>directory</var><dt><code>--source-prefix </code><var>directory</var><dd>A prefix for source file names to remove when generating the output
coverage files.  This option is useful when building in a separate
directory, and the pathname to the source directory is not wanted when
determining the output file names.  Note that this prefix detection is
applied before determining whether the source file is absolute.

     <br><dt><code>-t</code><dt><code>--stdout</code><dd>Output to standard output instead of output files.

     <br><dt><code>-u</code><dt><code>--unconditional-branches</code><dd>When branch probabilities are given, include those of unconditional branches. 
Unconditional branches are normally not interesting.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dt><code>--version</code><dd>Display the <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> version number (on the standard output),
and exit without doing any further processing.

     <br><dt><code>-w</code><dt><code>--verbose</code><dd>Print verbose informations related to basic blocks and arcs.

     <br><dt><code>-x</code><dt><code>--hash-filenames</code><dd>When using <var>&ndash;preserve-paths</var>,
gcov uses the full pathname of the source files to create
an output filename.  This can lead to long filenames that can overflow
filesystem limits.  This option creates names of the form
<samp><var>source-file</var><span class="file">##</span><var>md5</var><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp>,
where the <var>source-file</var> component is the final filename part and
the <var>md5</var> component is calculated from the full mangled name that
would have been used otherwise.  The option is an alternative
to the <var>&ndash;preserve-paths</var> on systems which have a filesystem limit.

 </dl>

 <p><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> should be run with the current directory the same as that
when you invoked the compiler.  Otherwise it will not be able to locate
the source files.  <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> produces files called
<samp><var>mangledname</var><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> in the current directory.  These contain
the coverage information of the source file they correspond to. 
One <samp><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> file is produced for each source (or header) file
containing code,
which was compiled to produce the data files.  The <var>mangledname</var> part
of the output file name is usually simply the source file name, but can
be something more complicated if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; options are
given.  Refer to those options for details.

 <p>If you invoke <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> with multiple input files, the
contributions from each input file are summed.  Typically you would
invoke it with the same list of files as the final link of your executable.

 <p>The <samp><span class="file">.gcov</span></samp> files contain the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; separated fields along with
program source code.  The format is

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>execution_count</var>:<var>line_number</var>:<var>source line text</var>
</pre>
 <p>Additional block information may succeed each line, when requested by
command line option.  The <var>execution_count</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; for lines
containing no code.  Unexecuted lines are marked &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#####</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=====</span></samp>&rsquo;, depending on whether they are reachable by
non-exceptional paths or only exceptional paths such as C++ exception
handlers, respectively. Given the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>&rsquo; option, unexecuted blocks are
marked &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$$$$$</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%%%%</span></samp>&rsquo;, depending on whether a basic block
is reachable via non-exceptional or exceptional paths. 
Executed basic blocks having a statement with zero <var>execution_count</var>
end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; character and are colored with magenta color with
the <samp><span class="option">-k</span></samp> option.  This functionality is not supported in Ada.

 <p>Note that GCC can completely remove the bodies of functions that are
not needed &ndash; for instance if they are inlined everywhere.  Such functions
are marked with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, which can be confusing. 
Use the <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-static-functions</span></samp>
options to retain these functions and
allow gcov to properly show their <var>execution_count</var>.

 <p>Some lines of information at the start have <var>line_number</var> of zero. 
These preamble lines are of the form

<pre class="smallexample">     -:0:<var>tag</var>:<var>value</var>
</pre>
 <p>The ordering and number of these preamble lines will be augmented as
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> development progresses &mdash; do not rely on them remaining
unchanged.  Use <var>tag</var> to locate a particular preamble line.

 <p>The additional block information is of the form

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>tag</var> <var>information</var>
</pre>
 <p>The <var>information</var> is human readable, but designed to be simple
enough for machine parsing too.

 <p>When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when the values
are <em>exactly</em> 0% and 100% respectively.  Other values which would
conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as the
nearest non-boundary value.

 <p>When using <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp>, you must first compile your program
with a special GCC option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--coverage</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This tells the compiler to generate additional information needed by
gcov (basically a flow graph of the program) and also includes
additional code in the object files for generating the extra profiling
information needed by gcov.  These additional files are placed in the
directory where the object file is located.

 <p>Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, an accompanying
<samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> file will be placed in the object file directory.

 <p>Running <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> with your program's source file names as arguments
will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution
for each line.  For example, if your program is called <samp><span class="file">tmp.cpp</span></samp>, this
is what you see when you use the basic <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> facility:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ g++ --coverage tmp.cpp
     $ a.out
     $ gcov tmp.cpp -m
     File 'tmp.cpp'
     Lines executed:92.86% of 14
     Creating 'tmp.cpp.gcov'
</pre>
 <p>The file <samp><span class="file">tmp.cpp.gcov</span></samp> contains output from <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp>. 
Here is a sample:

<pre class="smallexample">             -:    0:Source:tmp.cpp
             -:    0:Working directory:/home/gcc/testcase

             1:   36:  return 0;
             -:   37:}
</pre>
 <p>Note that line 7 is shown in the report multiple times.  First occurrence
presents total number of execution of the line and the next two belong
to instances of class Foo constructors.  As you can also see, line 30 contains
some unexecuted basic blocks and thus execution count has asterisk symbol.

 <p>When you use the <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> option, you will get individual block
counts, and the output looks like this:

 <p>In this mode, each basic block is only shown on one line &ndash; the last
line of the block.  A multi-line block will only contribute to the
execution count of that last line, and other lines will not be shown
to contain code, unless previous blocks end on those lines. 
The total execution count of a line is shown and subsequent lines show
the execution counts for individual blocks that end on that line.  After each
block, the branch and call counts of the block will be shown, if the
<samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> option is given.

 <p>Because of the way GCC instruments calls, a call count can be shown
after a line with no individual blocks. 
As you can see, line 33 contains a basic block that was not executed.

 <p>When you use the <samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> option, your output looks like this:

 <p>For each function, a line is printed showing how many times the function
is called, how many times it returns and what percentage of the
function's blocks were executed.

 <p>For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the basic
block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.  There can
be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line if there
are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this case, the
branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no simple way to map
these branches and calls back to source constructs.  In general, though,
the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost construct
on the source line.

 <p>For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
message &ldquo;never executed&rdquo; is printed.

 <p>For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
100%, but may be less for functions that call <code>exit</code> or <code>longjmp</code>,
and thus may not return every time they are called.

 <p>The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
executed again without removing the <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> file, the count for the
number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
program runs.

 <p>The data in the <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> files is saved immediately before the program
exits.  For each source file compiled with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, the
profiling code first attempts to read in an existing <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> file; if
the file doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block
counts) it will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the
new execution counts and finally writes the data to the file.
