<h3 class="section">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</h3>

<p><a name="index-optimize-options-887"></a><a name="index-options_002c-optimization-888"></a>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.

 <p>Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.

 <p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.

 <p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.

 <p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.

 <p>Most optimizations are completely disabled at <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp> or if an
<samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> level is not set on the command line, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.  Similarly, <samp><span class="option">-Og</span></samp> suppresses
many optimization passes.

 <p>Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with <samp><span class="option">-Q --help=optimizers</span></samp>
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level. 
See <a href="Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options">Overall Options</a>, for examples.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-O</code><dt><code>-O1</code><dd><a name="index-O-889"></a><a name="index-O1-890"></a>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.

     <!-- Note that in addition to the default_options_table list in opts.c, -->
     <!-- several optimization flags default to true but control optimization -->
     <!-- passes that are explicitly disabled at -O0. -->
     <p><samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> turns on the following optimization flags:

     <br><dt><code>-O3</code><dd><a name="index-O3-892"></a>Optimize yet more.  <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> turns on all optimizations specified
by <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and also turns on the following optimization flags:

</pre>
     <br><dt><code>-O0</code><dd><a name="index-O0-893"></a>Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-Os</code><dd><a name="index-Os-894"></a>Optimize for size.  <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> enables all <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> optimizations
except those that often increase code size:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
          -falign-labels  -falign-loops 
          -fprefetch-loop-arrays  -freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc
</pre>
     <p>It also enables <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp>, causes the compiler to tune for
code size rather than execution speed, and performs further optimizations
designed to reduce code size.

     <br><dt><code>-Ofast</code><dd><a name="index-Ofast-895"></a>Disregard strict standards compliance.  <samp><span class="option">-Ofast</span></samp> enables all
<samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard-compliant programs. 
It turns on <samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp> and the Fortran-specific
<samp><span class="option">-fstack-arrays</span></samp>, unless <samp><span class="option">-fmax-stack-var-size</span></samp> is
specified, and <samp><span class="option">-fno-protect-parens</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Og</code><dd><a name="index-Og-896"></a>Optimize debugging experience.  <samp><span class="option">-Og</span></samp> should be the optimization
level of choice for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering
a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation
and a good debugging experience.  It is a better choice than <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp>
for producing debuggable code because some compiler passes
that collect debug information are disabled at <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp>.

     <p>Like <samp><span class="option">-O0</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Og</span></samp> completely disables a number of
optimization passes so that individual options controlling them have
no effect.  Otherwise <samp><span class="option">-Og</span></samp> enables all <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp>
optimization flags except for those that may interfere with debugging:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -fbranch-count-reg  -fdelayed-branch 
          -fif-conversion  -fif-conversion2  
          -finline-functions-called-once 
          -fmove-loop-invariants  -fssa-phiopt 
          -ftree-bit-ccp  -ftree-pta  -ftree-sra
</pre>
     </dl>

 <p>If you use multiple <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.

 <p>Options of the form <samp><span class="option">-f</span><var>flag</var></samp> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <samp><span class="option">-ffoo</span></samp> is <samp><span class="option">-fno-foo</span></samp>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one you typically
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no-</span></samp>&rsquo;
or adding it.

 <p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; of
optimizations to be performed is desired.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fno-defer-pop</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefer_002dpop-897"></a><a name="index-fdefer_002dpop-898"></a>For machines that must pop arguments after a function call, always pop
the arguments as soon as each function returns. 
At levels <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp> and higher, <samp><span class="option">-fdefer-pop</span></samp> is the default;
this allows the compiler to let arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pop them all at once.

     <br><dt><code>-fforward-propagate</code><dd><a name="index-fforward_002dpropagate-899"></a>Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.

     <p>This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffp-contract=</code><var>style</var><dd><a name="index-ffp_002dcontract-900"></a><samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=off</span></samp> disables floating-point expression contraction. 
<samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=fast</span></samp> enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them. 
<samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=on</span></samp> enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to <samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=off</span></samp>.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=fast</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code><dd><a name="index-fomit_002dframe_002dpointer-901"></a>Omit the frame pointer in functions that don't need one.  This avoids the
instructions to save, set up and restore the frame pointer; on many targets
it also makes an extra register available.

     <p>On some targets this flag has no effect because the standard calling sequence
always uses a frame pointer, so it cannot be omitted.

     <p>Note that <samp><span class="option">-fno-omit-frame-pointer</span></samp> doesn't guarantee the frame pointer
is used in all functions.  Several targets always omit the frame pointer in
leaf functions.

     <p>Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-foptimize-sibling-calls</code><dd><a name="index-foptimize_002dsibling_002dcalls-902"></a>Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-foptimize-strlen</code><dd><a name="index-foptimize_002dstrlen-903"></a>Optimize various standard C string functions (e.g. <code>strlen</code>,
<code>strchr</code> or <code>strcpy</code>) and
their <code>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</code> counterparts into faster alternatives.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dinline-904"></a><a name="index-finline-905"></a>Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with
the <code>always_inline</code> attribute.  This is the default when not
optimizing.

     <p>Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them
with the <code>noinline</code> attribute.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-small-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dsmall_002dfunctions-906"></a>Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating
in this way.  This inlining applies to all functions, even those not declared
inline.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-findirect-inlining</code><dd><a name="index-findirect_002dinlining-907"></a>Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at compile
time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">-finline-small-functions</span></samp> options.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions-908"></a>Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not declared inline. 
The compiler heuristically decides which functions are worth integrating
in this way.

     <p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.  Also enabled
by <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fauto-profile</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-functions-called-once</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions_002dcalled_002donce-909"></a>Consider all <code>static</code> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <code>inline</code>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>,
but not <samp><span class="option">-Og</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fearly-inlining</code><dd><a name="index-fearly_002dinlining-910"></a>Inline functions marked by <code>always_inline</code> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.

     <p>Enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-sra</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dsra-911"></a>Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal of
unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by reference
by parameters passed by value.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-finline_002dlimit-912"></a>By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  <var>n</var> is the size of functions that
can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.

     <p>Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <samp><span class="option">--param </span><var>name</var><span class="option">=</span><var>value</var></samp>. 
The <samp><span class="option">-finline-limit=</span><var>n</var></samp> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:

          <dl>
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd>is set to <var>n</var>/2. 
<br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd>is set to <var>n</var>/2. 
</dl>

     <p>See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.

     <p><em>Note:</em> there may be no value to <samp><span class="option">-finline-limit</span></samp> that results
in default behavior.

     <p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dkeep_002dinline_002ddllexport-913"></a><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002ddllexport-914"></a>This is a more fine-grained version of <samp><span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span></samp>,
which applies only to functions that are declared using the <code>dllexport</code>
attribute or declspec.  See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Declaring Attributes of Functions</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions-915"></a>In C, emit <code>static</code> functions that are declared <code>inline</code>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<code>extern inline</code> extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-static-functions</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dfunctions-916"></a>Emit <code>static</code> functions into the object file, even if the function
is never used.

     <br><dt><code>-fkeep-static-consts</code><dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dconsts-917"></a>Emit variables declared <code>static const</code> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

     <p>GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if a variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <samp><span class="option">-fno-keep-static-consts</span></samp> option.

     <br><dt><code>-fmerge-constants</code><dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dconstants-918"></a>Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.

     <p>This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <samp><span class="option">-fno-merge-constants</span></samp> to inhibit this

one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete afterwards. 
For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are
clones, which means two copies of the function.  With this option, the

no code or data element resides at address zero. 
This option enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that a memory access to address zero always results in a trap, so
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.

     <p>Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true. 
Use <samp><span class="option">-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</span></samp> to disable this optimization

Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call
the set of likely targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect calls.  The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem

lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object has an indeterminate
value, and any changes during the lifetime of the object are dead when
the object is destroyed.  Normally dead store elimination will take
advantage of this; if your code relies on the value of the object
storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you can use this
flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores before the
constructor starts (e.g. because your operator new clears the object
storage) but still treat the object as dead after the destructor you,
can use <samp><span class="option">-flifetime-dse=1</span></samp>.  The default behavior can be

resulting in faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by GCC model the CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable
results from the algorithm.

     <p>This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with

     <br><dt><code>-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops</code><dd><a name="index-freschedule_002dmodulo_002dscheduled_002dloops-984"></a>Modulo scheduling is performed before traditional scheduling.  If a loop
is modulo scheduled, later scheduling passes may change its schedule. 
Use this option to control that behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fselective-scheduling</code><dd><a name="index-fselective_002dscheduling-985"></a>Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.  Selective

     <br><dt><code>-fsel-sched-pipelining</code><dd><a name="index-fsel_002dsched_002dpipelining-987"></a>Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during selective scheduling. 
This option has no effect unless one of <samp><span class="option">-fselective-scheduling</span></samp> or

     <br><dt><code>-fsemantic-interposition</code><dd><a name="index-fsemantic_002dinterposition-989"></a>Some object formats, like ELF, allow interposing of symbols by the
dynamic linker. 
This means that for symbols exported from the DSO, the compiler cannot perform
interprocedural propagation, inlining and other optimizations in anticipation
that the function or variable in question may change. While this feature is
useful, for example, to rewrite memory allocation functions by a debugging
implementation, it is expensive in the terms of code quality. 
With <samp><span class="option">-fno-semantic-interposition</span></samp> the compiler assumes that
if interposition happens for functions the overwriting function will have
precisely the same semantics (and side effects). 
Similarly if interposition happens
for variables, the constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag
has no effect for functions explicitly declared inline
(where it is never allowed for interposition to change semantics)
and for symbols explicitly declared weak.

     <br><dt><code>-fshrink-wrap</code><dd><a name="index-fshrink_002dwrap-990"></a>Emit function prologues only before parts of the function that need it,

     <br><dt><code>-fcaller-saves</code><dd><a name="index-fcaller_002dsaves-992"></a>Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code.

     <p>This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fcombine-stack-adjustments</code><dd><a name="index-fcombine_002dstack_002dadjustments-993"></a>Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory references

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-ra</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dra-994"></a>Use caller save registers for allocation if those registers are not used by
any called function.  In that case it is not necessary to save and restore
them around calls.  This is only possible if called functions are part of
same compilation unit as current function and they are compiled before it.

     <p>Enabled at levels <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>, however the option
is disabled if generated code will be instrumented for profiling
(<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="option">-pg</span></samp>) or if callee's register usage cannot be known
exactly (this happens on targets that do not expose prologues
and epilogues in RTL).

     <br><dt><code>-fconserve-stack</code><dd><a name="index-fconserve_002dstack-995"></a>Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to use less
stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This option
implies setting the <samp><span class="option">large-stack-frame</span></samp> parameter to 100
and the <samp><span class="option">large-stack-frame-growth</span></samp> parameter to 400.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-reassoc</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dreassoc-996"></a>Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default

     <br><dt><code>-fcode-hoisting</code><dd><a name="index-fcode_002dhoisting-997"></a>Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the
evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the function exit
as early as possible.  This is especially useful as a code size
optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well. 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-fre</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dfre-1001"></a>Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation. 
This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies. 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-phiprop</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dphiprop-1002"></a>Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This

by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-ftree-copy-prop</code><dd><a name="index-ftree_002dcopy_002dprop-1004"></a>Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary
copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-stack-alignment</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dstack_002dalignment-1008"></a>Reduce stack alignment on call sites if possible. 
Enabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-pta</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dpta-1009"></a>Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-profile</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dprofile-1010"></a>Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
<code>cold</code>, <code>noreturn</code>, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size. 
Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-cp</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dcp-1011"></a>Perform interprocedural constant propagation. 
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly. 
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions. 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>. 
It is also enabled by <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fauto-profile</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-cp-clone</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dcp_002dclone-1012"></a>Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger. 
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments. 
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see <samp><span class="option">--param ipcp-unit-growth=</span><var>value</var></samp>). 
This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>. 
It is also enabled by <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fauto-profile</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-bit-cp</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dbit_002dcp-1013"></a>When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
propagation. This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and
by <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fauto-profile</span></samp>. 
It requires that <samp><span class="option">-fipa-cp</span></samp> is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-vrp</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dvrp-1014"></a>When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value
ranges. This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp>. It requires
that <samp><span class="option">-fipa-cp</span></samp> is enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-fipa-icf</code><dd><a name="index-fipa_002dicf-1015"></a>Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only variables. 
The optimization reduces code size and may disturb unwind stacks by replacing
a function by equivalent one with a different name. The optimization works
more effectively with link-time optimization enabled.

     <p>Although the behavior is similar to the Gold Linker's ICF optimization, GCC ICF
works on different levels and thus the optimizations are not same - there are
equivalences that are found only by GCC and equivalences found only by Gold.

     <p>This flag is enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Os</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-flive-patching=</code><var>level</var><dd><a name="index-flive_002dpatching-1016"></a>Control GCC's optimizations to produce output suitable for live-patching.

     <p>If the compiler's optimization uses a function's body or information extracted
from its body to optimize/change another function, the latter is called an
impacted function of the former.  If a function is patched, its impacted
functions should be patched too.

     <p>The impacted functions are determined by the compiler's interprocedural
optimizations.  For example, a caller is impacted when inlining a function
into its caller,
cloning a function and changing its caller to call this new clone,
or extracting a function's pureness/constness information to optimize
its direct or indirect callers, etc.

     <p>Usually, the more IPA optimizations enabled, the larger the number of
impacted functions for each function.  In order to control the number of
impacted functions and more easily compute the list of impacted function,
IPA optimizations can be partially enabled at two different levels.

     <p>The <var>level</var> argument should be one of the following:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inline-clone</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>
Only enable inlining and cloning optimizations, which includes inlining,
cloning, interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates and partial inlining. 
As a result, when patching a function, all its callers and its clones'
callers are impacted, therefore need to be patched as well.

          <p><samp><span class="option">-flive-patching=inline-clone</span></samp> disables the following optimization flags:
          <pre class="smallexample">               -fwhole-program  -fipa-pta  -fipa-reference  -fipa-ra 
               -fipa-icf  -fipa-icf-functions  -fipa-icf-variables 
               -fipa-bit-cp  -fipa-vrp  -fipa-pure-const  -fipa-reference-addressable 
               -fipa-stack-alignment
</pre>
          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">inline-only-static</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>
Only enable inlining of static functions. 
As a result, when patching a static function, all its callers are impacted
and so need to be patched as well.

          <p>In addition to all the flags that <samp><span class="option">-flive-patching=inline-clone</span></samp>
disables,
<samp><span class="option">-flive-patching=inline-only-static</span></samp> disables the following additional

</pre>
          </dl>

     <p>When <samp><span class="option">-flive-patching</span></samp> is specified without any value, the default value
is <var>inline-clone</var>.

     <p>This flag is disabled by default.

are hard to handle at RTL level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With <samp><span class="option">-funswitch-loops</span></samp> it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes

in such a way that its value when exiting the loop can be determined using
only its initial value and the number of loop iterations, replace uses of

This reduces data dependencies and may allow further simplifications. 
Enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> and higher.

This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option

propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at <samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> and higher.  Null pointer check

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002daliasing-1078"></a>Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

     <p><a name="Type_002dpunning"></a>Pay special attention to code like this:
     <pre class="smallexample">          union a_union {

            double d;
          };

            t.d = 3.0;
            return t.i;
          }
</pre>
     <p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called &ldquo;type-punning&rdquo;) is common.  Even with
<samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.  See <a href="Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation.html#Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation">Structures unions enumerations and bit-fields implementation</a>.  However, this code might not:
     <pre class="smallexample">          int f() {
            union a_union t;
            int* ip;

            ip = &amp;t.i;
            return *ip;
          }
</pre>
     <p>Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:

     <p>This option should not be used in combination with <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp>. 
Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.

     <br><dt><code>-flto[=</code><var>n</var><code>]</code><dd><a name="index-flto-1088"></a>This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.

     <p>To use the link-time optimizer, <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link. 
It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time. 
For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
          gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
          gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
</pre>
     <p>The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation
of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from
<samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp>, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
<samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
<samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp> into functions in <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> and vice-versa.

     <p>Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
</pre>
     <p>The above generates bytecode for <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bar.c</span></samp>,
merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce <samp><span class="file">myprog</span></samp>.

     <p>The important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform the link step. 
GCC automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> command-line option. 
You can always override
the automatic decision to do link-time optimization
by passing <samp><span class="option">-fno-lto</span></samp> to the link command.

     <p>To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see <samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp>) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, <samp><span class="option">-fwhole-program</span></samp> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.

     <p>When a file is compiled with <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> without
<samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp>, the generated object file is larger than
a regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual
final code (see <samp><span class="option">-ffat-lto-objects</span></samp>.  This means that
object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object
files; if <samp><span class="option">-fno-lto</span></samp> is passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
<samp><span class="option">-fno-fat-lto-objects</span></samp> is enabled the compile stage is faster
but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.

     <p>When producing the final binary, GCC only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode. 
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC automatically selects
which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without
further processing.

     <p>Generally, options specified at link time override those
specified at compile time, although in some cases GCC attempts to infer
link-time options from the settings used to compile the input files.

     <p>If you do not specify an optimization level option <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> at
link time, then GCC uses the highest optimization level
used when compiling the object files.  Note that it is generally
ineffective to specify an optimization level option only at link time and
not at compile time, for two reasons.  First, compiling without
optimization suppresses compiler passes that gather information
needed for effective optimization at link time.  Second, some early
optimization passes can be performed only at compile time and
not at link time.

     <p>There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link. 
Currently, the following options and their settings are taken from
the first object file that explicitly specifies them:
<samp><span class="option">-fPIC</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fpic</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fpie</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fcommon</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-fexceptions</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fnon-call-exceptions</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fgnu-tm</span></samp>
and all the <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp> target flags.

     <p>Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all compilation units,
and trying to override this at link time with a conflicting value
is ignored.  This includes options such as <samp><span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span></samp>.

     <p>Other options such as <samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fno-strict-overflow</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fno-trapv</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fno-strict-aliasing</span></samp>
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
<samp><span class="option">-fno-strict-overflow</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fwrapv</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fno-trapv</span></samp> take
precedence; and for example <samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=off</span></samp> takes precedence
over <samp><span class="option">-ffp-contract=fast</span></samp>.  You can override them at link time.

     <p>If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.

     <p>Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -c -flto foo.c
          g++ -c -flto bar.cc
          gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
          g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran
</pre>
     <p>Notice that the final link is done with <samp><span class="command">g++</span></samp> to get the C++
runtime libraries and <samp><span class="option">-lgfortran</span></samp> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.

     <p>If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
<samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp>, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To create static libraries suitable
for LTO, use <samp><span class="command">gcc-ar</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">gcc-ranlib</span></samp> instead of <samp><span class="command">ar</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="command">ranlib</span></samp>;
to show the symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use
<samp><span class="command">gcc-nm</span></samp>.  Those commands require that <samp><span class="command">ar</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ranlib</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="command">nm</span></samp> have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the
flag <samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp> to ensure that the library participates in
the LTO optimization process:

     <pre class="smallexample">          gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo
</pre>
     <p>With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
GIMPLE files from <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp> and passes them on to the running GCC
to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.

     <p>If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <samp><span class="file">libfoo.a</span></samp>
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the LTO optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable
for both LTO optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
<samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> <samp><span class="option">-ffat-lto-objects</span></samp>.

     <p>Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fwhole-program</span></samp> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities. 
Use of <samp><span class="option">-fwhole-program</span></samp> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see <samp><span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span></samp>).

     <p>The current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
GCC do not work with an older or newer version of GCC.

     <p>Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information on systems other than those using a combination of ELF and
DWARF.

     <p>If you specify the optional <var>n</var>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <var>n</var>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> program.  The
environment variable <samp><span class="env">MAKE</span></samp> may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for <var>n</var> is 1.

     <p>You can also specify <samp><span class="option">-flto=jobserver</span></samp> to use GNU make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel. 
You must prepend a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if <samp><span class="env">MAKE</span></samp> is
GNU make.

into equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">max</span></samp>&rsquo; to create

partitioning is intended for internal testing only. 
The value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">one</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies that exactly one partition should be
used while the value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">none</span></samp>&rsquo; bypasses partitioning and executes
the link-time optimization step directly from the WPA phase.

     <p>This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic

See <samp><span class="option">-flto</span></samp> for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.

     <p>This option is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is enabled

     <p><samp><span class="option">-fno-fat-lto-objects</span></samp> improves compilation time over plain LTO, but

 <p>The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point

correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-ffloat-store</code><dd><a name="index-ffloat_002dstore-1099"></a>Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating-point value is taken from a
register or memory.

     <p><a name="index-floating_002dpoint-precision-1100"></a>This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <code>double</code> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use <samp><span class="option">-ffloat-store</span></samp> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.

     <br><dt><code>-fexcess-precision=</code><var>style</var><dd><a name="index-fexcess_002dprecision-1101"></a>This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point operations occur in a format with more precision or
range than the IEEE standard and interchange floating-point types.  By
default, <samp><span class="option">-fexcess-precision=fast</span></samp> is in effect; this means that
operations may be carried out in a wider precision than the types specified
in the source if that would result in faster code, and it is unpredictable
when rounding to the types specified in the source code takes place. 
When compiling C, if <samp><span class="option">-fexcess-precision=standard</span></samp> is specified then
excess precision follows the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas <samp><span class="option">-ffloat-store</span></samp> only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as <samp><span class="option">-std=c99</span></samp> is used. 
<samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp> enables <samp><span class="option">-fexcess-precision=fast</span></samp> by default
regardless of whether a strict conformance option is used.

     <p><a name="index-mfpmath-1102"></a><samp><span class="option">-fexcess-precision=standard</span></samp> is not implemented for languages
other than C.  On the x86, it has no effect if <samp><span class="option">-mfpmath=sse</span></samp>

     <p>This option is not turned on by any <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> option besides
<samp><span class="option">-Ofast</span></samp> since it can result in incorrect output for programs

     <br><dt><code>-fassociative-math</code><dd><a name="index-fassociative_002dmath-1107"></a>
Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations. 
This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
<code>(x + 2**52) - 2**52</code>.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required. 
This option requires that both <samp><span class="option">-fno-signed-zeros</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fno-trapping-math</span></samp> be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with <samp><span class="option">-frounding-math</span></samp>. For Fortran the option

     <br><dt><code>-freciprocal-math</code><dd><a name="index-freciprocal_002dmath-1108"></a>
Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example <code>x / y</code>
can be replaced with <code>x * (1/y)</code>, which is useful if <code>(1/y)</code>
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fno-reciprocal-math</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffinite-math-only</code><dd><a name="index-ffinite_002dmath_002donly-1109"></a>Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
that arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.

     <p>This option is not turned on by any <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.

     <p>The default is <samp><span class="option">-fno-finite-math-only</span></samp>.

signedness of zero.  IEEE arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and &minus;0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with <samp><span class="option">-ffinite-math-only</span></samp>).

allow faster code if one relies on &ldquo;non-stop&rdquo; IEEE arithmetic, for example.

     <p>This option should never be turned on by any <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> option since

     <p>This is particularly useful for assumed-shape arrays in Fortran where

in the output file.

     <p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to
improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the
ELF object format have linkers with such optimizations.  On AIX, the linker
rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on the call graph.  The performance impact
varies.

     <p>Together with a linker garbage collection (linker <samp><span class="option">--gc-sections</span></samp>
option) these options may lead to smaller statically-linked executables (after
stripping).

     <p>On ELF/DWARF systems these options do not degenerate the quality of the debug
information.  There could be issues with other object files/debug info formats.

     <p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.  When
you specify these options, the assembler and linker create larger object and
executable files and are also slower.  These options affect code generation. 
They prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using relative
locations inside a translation unit since the locations are unknown until
link time.  An example of such an optimization is relaxing calls to short call
instructions.

optimization that is done.  For example, GCC does not inline functions
that contain more than a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command line using the

     <p>The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are

without notice in future releases.

     <p>In order to get minimal, maximal and default value of a parameter,
one can use <samp><span class="option">--help=param -Q</span></samp> options.

     <p>In each case, the <var>value</var> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<var>name</var> are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>predictable-branch-outcome</code><dd>When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than this threshold
(in percent), then it is considered well predictable.

          <br><dt><code>max-rtl-if-conversion-insns</code><dd>RTL if-conversion tries to remove conditional branches around a block and
replace them with conditionally executed instructions.  This parameter
gives the maximum number of instructions in a block which should be
considered for if-conversion.  The compiler will
also use other heuristics to decide whether if-conversion is likely to be
profitable.

          <br><dt><code>max-rtl-if-conversion-predictable-cost</code><dt><code>max-rtl-if-conversion-unpredictable-cost</code><dd>RTL if-conversion will try to remove conditional branches around a block
and replace them with conditionally executed instructions.  These parameters
give the maximum permissible cost for the sequence that would be generated
by if-conversion depending on whether the branch is statically determined
to be predictable or not.  The units for this parameter are the same as
those for the GCC internal seq_cost metric.  The compiler will try to
provide a reasonable default for this parameter using the BRANCH_COST
target macro.

          <br><dt><code>max-crossjump-edges</code><dd>The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping. 
The algorithm used by <samp><span class="option">-fcrossjumping</span></samp> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.

          <br><dt><code>min-crossjump-insns</code><dd>The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end
of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
cross-jumped from are matched.

          <br><dt><code>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</code><dd>The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.

          <br><dt><code>max-goto-duplication-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-insn-search</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions are searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
are minimal, so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-live-search</code><dd>When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-memory</code><dd>The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization is not done.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-insertion-ratio</code><dd>If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value
for any expression, then RTL PRE inserts or removes the expression and thus
leaves partially redundant computations in the instruction stream.

          <br><dt><code>max-pending-list-length</code><dd>The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling allows
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.

          <br><dt><code>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts</code><dd>The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make
when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can exponentially increase
compilation time.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd>Several parameters control the tree inliner used in GCC. 
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
considers for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++).

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd>When you use <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-small</code><dd>This is bound applied to calls which are considered relevant with
<samp><span class="option">-finline-small-functions</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-size</code><dd>This is bound applied to calls which are optimized for size. Small growth
may be desirable to anticipate optimization oppurtunities exposed by inlining.

          <br><dt><code>uninlined-function-insns</code><dd>Number of instructions accounted by inliner for function overhead such as
function prologue and epilogue.

          <br><dt><code>uninlined-function-time</code><dd>Extra time accounted by inliner for function overhead such as time needed to
execute function prologue and epilogue

          <br><dt><code>uninlined-thunk-insns</code><br><dt><code>uninlined-thunk-time</code><dd>Same as <samp><span class="option">--param uninlined-function-insns</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">--param uninlined-function-time</span></samp> but applied to function thunks

          <br><dt><code>inline-min-speedup</code><dd>When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee runtime exceeds this
threshold (in percent), the function can be inlined regardless of the limit on
<samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-single</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--param
max-inline-insns-auto</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>large-function-insns</code><dd>The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
<samp><span class="option">--param large-function-growth</span></samp>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
back end.

          <br><dt><code>large-function-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents. 
For example, parameter value 100 limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.

          <br><dt><code>large-unit-insns</code><dd>The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by <samp><span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span></samp>. 
For small units this might be too tight. 
For example, consider a unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <samp><span class="option">--param large-unit-insns</span></samp>
before applying <samp><span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>inline-unit-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining. 
For example, parameter value 20 limits unit growth to 1.2 times the original
size. Cold functions (either marked cold via an attribute or by profile
feedback) are not accounted into the unit size.

          <br><dt><code>ipcp-unit-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by
interprocedural constant propagation.  For example, parameter value 10 limits
unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.

          <br><dt><code>large-stack-frame</code><dd>The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.

          <br><dt><code>large-stack-frame-growth</code><dd>Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents. 
For example, parameter value 1000 limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-recursive</code><dt><code>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</code><dd>Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line copy of a
self-recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.

          <p><samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive</span></samp> applies to functions
declared inline. 
For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) is
enabled; <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</span></samp> applies instead.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-recursive-depth</code><dt><code>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</code><dd>Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive inlining.

          <p><samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth</span></samp> applies to functions
declared inline.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <samp><span class="option">-finline-functions</span></samp> (included in <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) is
enabled; <samp><span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</span></samp> applies instead.

          <br><dt><code>min-inline-recursive-probability</code><dd>Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.

          <p>When profile feedback is available (see <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp>) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from the probability that function recurses
via a given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call
expressions whose probability exceeds the given threshold (in percents).

          <br><dt><code>early-inlining-insns</code><dd>Specify growth that the early inliner can make.  In effect it increases
the amount of inlining for code having a large abstraction penalty.

          <br><dt><code>max-early-inliner-iterations</code><dd>Limit of iterations of the early inliner.  This basically bounds
the number of nested indirect calls the early inliner can resolve. 
Deeper chains are still handled by late inlining.

          <br><dt><code>comdat-sharing-probability</code><dd>Probability (in percent) that C++ inline function with comdat visibility
are shared across multiple compilation units.

          <br><dt><code>profile-func-internal-id</code><dd>A parameter to control whether to use function internal id in profile
database lookup. If the value is 0, the compiler uses an id that
is based on function assembler name and filename, which makes old profile
data more tolerant to source changes such as function reordering etc.

          <br><dt><code>min-vect-loop-bound</code><dd>The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not vectorized
when <samp><span class="option">-ftree-vectorize</span></samp> is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option
to allow vectorization.

          <br><dt><code>gcse-cost-distance-ratio</code><dd>Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by GCSE optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
is with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than <samp><span class="option">gcse-unrestricted-cost</span></samp>.  Specifying 0 disables
hoisting of simple expressions.

          <br><dt><code>gcse-unrestricted-cost</code><dd>Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which GCSE optimizations do not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,
the more aggressive code hoisting is.  Specifying 0
allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.

          <br><dt><code>max-hoist-depth</code><dd>The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist. 
This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting algorithm. 
The value of 0 does not limit on the search, but may slow down compilation
of huge functions.

          <br><dt><code>max-tail-merge-comparisons</code><dd>The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with.  This is used to
avoid quadratic behavior in tree tail merging.

          <br><dt><code>max-tail-merge-iterations</code><dd>The maximum amount of iterations of the pass over the function.  This is used to
limit compilation time in tree tail merging.

          <br><dt><code>store-merging-allow-unaligned</code><dd>Allow the store merging pass to introduce unaligned stores if it is legal to
do so.

          <br><dt><code>max-stores-to-merge</code><dd>The maximum number of stores to attempt to merge into wider stores in the store
merging pass.

          <br><dt><code>max-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be unrolled. 
If a loop is unrolled, this parameter also determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>max-average-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop may have to be unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled,
this parameter also determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>max-unroll-times</code><dd>The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-peeled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be peeled. 
If a loop is peeled, this parameter also determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.

          <br><dt><code>max-peel-times</code><dd>The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-peel-branches</code><dd>The maximum number of branches on the hot path through the peeled sequence.

          <br><dt><code>max-completely-peeled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-completely-peel-times</code><dd>The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.

          <br><dt><code>max-completely-peel-loop-nest-depth</code><dd>The maximum depth of a loop nest suitable for complete peeling.

          <br><dt><code>max-unswitch-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.

          <br><dt><code>max-unswitch-level</code><dd>The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.

          <br><dt><code>lim-expensive</code><dd>The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.

          <br><dt><code>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</code><dd>Bound on number of candidates for induction variables, below which
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  If there are more candidates than this,
only the most relevant ones are considered to avoid quadratic time complexity.

          <br><dt><code>iv-max-considered-uses</code><dd>The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.

          <br><dt><code>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</code><dd>If the number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set
when adding a new one.

          <br><dt><code>avg-loop-niter</code><dd>Average number of iterations of a loop.

          <br><dt><code>dse-max-object-size</code><dd>Maximum size (in bytes) of objects tracked bytewise by dead store elimination. 
Larger values may result in larger compilation times.

          <br><dt><code>dse-max-alias-queries-per-store</code><dd>Maximum number of queries into the alias oracle per store. 
Larger values result in larger compilation times and may result in more
removed dead stores.

          <br><dt><code>scev-max-expr-size</code><dd>Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer. 
Large expressions slow the analyzer.

          <br><dt><code>scev-max-expr-complexity</code><dd>Bound on the complexity of the expressions in the scalar evolutions analyzer. 
Complex expressions slow the analyzer.

          <br><dt><code>max-tree-if-conversion-phi-args</code><dd>Maximum number of arguments in a PHI supported by TREE if conversion
unless the loop is marked with simd pragma.

          <br><dt><code>vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks</code><dd>The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed when
doing loop versioning for alignment in the vectorizer.

          <br><dt><code>vect-max-version-for-alias-checks</code><dd>The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed when
doing loop versioning for alias in the vectorizer.

          <br><dt><code>vect-max-peeling-for-alignment</code><dd>The maximum number of loop peels to enhance access alignment
for vectorizer. Value -1 means no limit.

          <br><dt><code>max-iterations-to-track</code><dd>The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute-force algorithm
for analysis of the number of iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-count-ws-permille</code><dd>A basic block profile count is considered hot if it contributes to
the given permillage (i.e. 0...1000) of the entire profiled execution.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</code><dd>Select fraction of the entry block frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.

          <br><dt><code>max-predicted-iterations</code><dd>The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and
another loop with unknown bound. 
The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds appears artificially cold relative to the other one.

          <br><dt><code>builtin-expect-probability</code><dd>Control the probability of the expression having the specified value. This
parameter takes a percentage (i.e. 0 ... 100) as input.

          <br><dt><code>builtin-string-cmp-inline-length</code><dd>The maximum length of a constant string for a builtin string cmp call
eligible for inlining.

          <br><dt><code>align-threshold</code><dd>
Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of a basic block in
a function to align the basic block.

          <br><dt><code>align-loop-iterations</code><dd>
A loop expected to iterate at least the selected number of iterations is
aligned.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage</code><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</code><dd>
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.

          <p>The <samp><span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</span></samp> parameter
is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-max-code-growth</code><dd>Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
a rather artificial limit, as most of the duplicates are eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio</code><dd>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-probability</code><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</code><dd>
Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower than this
threshold.

          <p>Similarly to <samp><span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage</span></samp> two parameters are
provided.  <samp><span class="option">tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</span></samp> is used for
compilation with profile feedback and <samp><span class="option">tracer-min-branch-probability</span></samp>
compilation without.  The value for compilation with profile feedback
needs to be more conservative (higher) in order to make tracer
effective.

          <br><dt><code>stack-clash-protection-guard-size</code><dd>Specify the size of the operating system provided stack guard as
2 raised to <var>num</var> bytes.  Higher values may reduce the
number of explicit probes, but a value larger than the operating system
provided guard will leave code vulnerable to stack clash style attacks.

          <br><dt><code>stack-clash-protection-probe-interval</code><dd>Stack clash protection involves probing stack space as it is allocated.  This
param controls the maximum distance between probes into the stack as 2 raised
to <var>num</var> bytes.  Higher values may reduce the number of explicit probes, but a value
larger than the operating system provided guard will leave code vulnerable to
stack clash style attacks.

          <br><dt><code>max-cse-path-length</code><dd>
The maximum number of basic blocks on path that CSE considers.

          <br><dt><code>max-cse-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions CSE processes before flushing.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-expand</code><dd>
GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections. 
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when
RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If <code>getrlimit</code> is available, the notion of &ldquo;RAM&rdquo; is
the smallest of actual RAM and <code>RLIMIT_DATA</code> or <code>RLIMIT_AS</code>.  If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<samp><span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span></samp> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-heapsize</code><dd>
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span></samp>% beyond <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span></samp>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that
tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and <samp><span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span></samp> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.

          <br><dt><code>max-reload-search-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent

Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time
increase with probably slightly better performance.

          <br><dt><code>max-sched-ready-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should
consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
with probably little benefit.

interblock scheduling.

          <br><dt><code>max-pipeline-region-blocks</code><dd>The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for

          <br><dt><code>selsched-max-sched-times</code><dd>The maximum number of times that an instruction is scheduled during
selective scheduling.  This is the limit on the number of iterations
through which the instruction may be pipelined.

          <br><dt><code>selsched-insns-to-rename</code><dd>The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list that are considered
for renaming in the selective scheduler.

          <br><dt><code>integer-share-limit</code><dd>Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the
compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum
value of a shared integer constant.

          <br><dt><code>ssp-buffer-size</code><dd>The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that receive stack smashing

duplicated when threading jumps.

          <br><dt><code>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</code><dd>Maximum number of fields in a structure treated in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.

          <br><dt><code>prefetch-latency</code><dd>Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed before
prefetch finishes.  The distance prefetched ahead is proportional
to this constant.  Increasing this number may also lead to less
streams being prefetched (see <samp><span class="option">simultaneous-prefetches</span></samp>).

          <br><dt><code>simultaneous-prefetches</code><dd>Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.

          <br><dt><code>l1-cache-line-size</code><dd>The size of cache line in L1 data cache, in bytes.

          <br><dt><code>prefetch-dynamic-strides</code><dd>Whether the loop array prefetch pass should issue software prefetch hints
for strides that are non-constant.  In some cases this may be
beneficial, though the fact the stride is non-constant may make it
hard to predict when there is clear benefit to issuing these hints.

          <p>Set to 1 if the prefetch hints should be issued for non-constant
strides.  Set to 0 if prefetch hints should be issued only for strides that
are known to be constant and below <samp><span class="option">prefetch-minimum-stride</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>prefetch-minimum-stride</code><dd>Minimum constant stride, in bytes, to start using prefetch hints for.  If
the stride is less than this threshold, prefetch hints will not be issued.

          <p>This setting is useful for processors that have hardware prefetchers, in
which case there may be conflicts between the hardware prefetchers and
the software prefetchers.  If the hardware prefetchers have a maximum
stride they can handle, it should be used here to improve the use of
software prefetchers.

          <p>A value of -1 means we don't have a threshold and therefore
prefetch hints can be issued for any constant stride.

          <p>This setting is only useful for strides that are known and constant.

          <br><dt><code>loop-interchange-max-num-stmts</code><dd>The maximum number of stmts in a loop to be interchanged.

          <br><dt><code>loop-interchange-stride-ratio</code><dd>The minimum ratio between stride of two loops for interchange to be profitable.

number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.

          <br><dt><code>use-canonical-types</code><dd>Whether the compiler should use the &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; type system. 
Should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal
mechanism for comparing types in C++ and Objective-C++.  However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures,
set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.

          <br><dt><code>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</code><dd>Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays that are
bigger than <samp><span class="option">switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</span></samp> times the number of

partial redundancy elimination optimization (<samp><span class="option">-ftree-pre</span></samp>) when
optimizing at <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp> and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter allows an unlimited set length.

          <br><dt><code>rpo-vn-max-loop-depth</code><dd>Maximum loop depth that is value-numbered optimistically. 
When the limit hits the innermost
<var>rpo-vn-max-loop-depth</var> loops and the outermost loop in the
loop nest are value-numbered optimistically and the remaining ones not.

          <br><dt><code>sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access</code><dd>Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking for
redundancies for loads and stores.  If this limit is hit the search
is aborted and the load or store is not considered redundant.  The
number of queries is algorithmically limited to the number of
stores on all paths from the load to the function entry.

          <br><dt><code>ira-max-loops-num</code><dd>IRA uses regional register allocation by default.  If a function
contains more loops than the number given by this parameter, only at most
the given number of the most frequently-executed loops form regions
for regional register allocation.

          <br><dt><code>ira-max-conflict-table-size</code><dd>Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict
table, the table can still require excessive amounts of memory for
huge functions.  If the conflict table for a function could be more
than the size in MB given by this parameter, the register allocator
instead uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality
algorithm that does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table.

          <br><dt><code>ira-loop-reserved-regs</code><dd>IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops
for decisions to move loop invariants (see <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>).  The number
of available registers reserved for some other purposes is given
by this parameter.  Default of the parameter
is the best found from numerous experiments.

          <br><dt><code>lra-inheritance-ebb-probability-cutoff</code><dd>LRA tries to reuse values reloaded in registers in subsequent insns. 
This optimization is called inheritance.  EBB is used as a region to
do this optimization.  The parameter defines a minimal fall-through
edge probability in percentage used to add BB to inheritance EBB in
LRA.  The default value was chosen
from numerous runs of SPEC2000 on x86-64.

          <br><dt><code>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop</code><dd>Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and
in amount of needed compile-time memory, with very large loops.  Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
motion optimization performed on them.

          <br><dt><code>loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps</code><dd>Building data dependencies is expensive for very large loops.  This
parameter limits the number of data references in loops that are
considered for data dependence analysis.  These large loops are no
handled by the optimizations using loop data dependencies.

          <br><dt><code>max-vartrack-size</code><dd>Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.

          <br><dt><code>max-vartrack-expr-depth</code><dd>Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to map
variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades
compilation time for more complete debug information.  If this is set too
low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in
debug information may end up not being used; setting this higher may
enable the compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile
time and memory use may grow.

          <br><dt><code>max-debug-marker-count</code><dd>Sets a threshold on the number of debug markers (e.g. begin stmt
markers) to avoid complexity explosion at inlining or expanding to RTL. 
If a function has more such gimple stmts than the set limit, such stmts
will be dropped from the inlined copy of a function, and from its RTL
expansion.

          <br><dt><code>min-nondebug-insn-uid</code><dd>Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below
the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by
<samp><span class="option">-fvar-tracking-assignments</span></samp>, but debug insns may get
(non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range is exhausted.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</code><dd>IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new
parameters only when their cumulative size is less or equal to
<samp><span class="option">ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</span></samp> times the size of the original
pointer parameter.

          <br><dt><code>sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</code><dt><code>sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</code><dd>The two Scalar Reduction of Aggregates passes (SRA and IPA-SRA) aim to
replace scalar parts of aggregates with uses of independent scalar
variables.  These parameters control the maximum size, in storage units,
of aggregate which is considered for replacement when compiling for
speed
(<samp><span class="option">sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</span></samp>) or size
(<samp><span class="option">sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</span></samp>) respectively.

          <br><dt><code>tm-max-aggregate-size</code><dd>When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this
parameter specifies the size in bytes after which variables are
saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore code
sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using
<samp><span class="option">-fgnu-tm</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>graphite-max-nb-scop-params</code><dd>To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded. 
A value of zero can be used to lift
the bound.  A variable whose value is unknown at compilation time and
defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.

          <br><dt><code>loop-block-tile-size</code><dd>Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
<samp><span class="option">-floop-block</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-floop-strip-mine</span></samp>, strip mine each
loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
length can be changed using the <samp><span class="option">loop-block-tile-size</span></samp>
parameter.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-value-list-size</code><dd>IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed to a function's
parameter in order to propagate them and perform devirtualization. 
<samp><span class="option">ipa-cp-value-list-size</span></samp> is the maximum number of values and types it
stores per one formal parameter of a function.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-eval-threshold</code><dd>IPA-CP calculates its own score of cloning profitability heuristics
and performs those cloning opportunities with scores that exceed
<samp><span class="option">ipa-cp-eval-threshold</span></samp>.

are evaluated for cloning.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-single-call-penalty</code><dd>Percentage penalty functions containing a single call to another
function will receive when they are evaluated for cloning.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-max-agg-items</code><dd>IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar values passed
in an aggregate. <samp><span class="option">ipa-max-agg-items</span></samp> controls the maximum
number of such values per one parameter.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</code><dd>When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the number
of iterations of a loop known, it adds a bonus of
<samp><span class="option">ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</span></samp> to the profitability score of
the candidate.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus</code><dd>When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the index of
an array access known, it adds a bonus of
<samp><span class="option">ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus</span></samp> to the profitability
score of the candidate.

          <br><dt><code>ipa-max-aa-steps</code><dd>During its analysis of function bodies, IPA-CP employs alias analysis
in order to track values pointed to by function parameters.  In order
not spend too much time analyzing huge functions, it gives up and
consider all memory clobbered after examining
<samp><span class="option">ipa-max-aa-steps</span></samp> statements modifying memory.

          <br><dt><code>lto-partitions</code><dd>Specify desired number of partitions produced during WHOPR compilation. 
The number of partitions should exceed the number of CPUs used for compilation.

          <br><dt><code>lto-min-partition</code><dd>Size of minimal partition for WHOPR (in estimated instructions).

partitions.

name lookup fails for an identifier.

          <br><dt><code>sink-frequency-threshold</code><dd>The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of the target block
relative to a statement's original block to allow statement sinking of a
statement.  Larger numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking. 
A small positive adjustment is applied for
statements with memory operands as those are even more profitable so sink.

          <br><dt><code>max-stores-to-sink</code><dd>The maximum number of conditional store pairs that can be sunk.  Set to 0
if either vectorization (<samp><span class="option">-ftree-vectorize</span></samp>) or if-conversion
(<samp><span class="option">-ftree-loop-if-convert</span></samp>) is disabled.

          <br><dt><code>allow-store-data-races</code><dd>Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on stores.

0, use the default for the machine.

reassociated tree. This parameter overrides target dependent
heuristics used by default if has non zero value.

          <br><dt><code>sched-pressure-algorithm</code><dd>Choose between the two available implementations of
<samp><span class="option">-fsched-pressure</span></samp>.  Algorithm 1 is the original implementation
and is the more likely to prevent instructions from being reordered. 
Algorithm 2 was designed to be a compromise between the relatively
conservative approach taken by algorithm 1 and the rather aggressive
approach taken by the default scheduler.  It relies more heavily on
having a regular register file and accurate register pressure classes. 
See <samp><span class="file">haifa-sched.c</span></samp> in the GCC sources for more details.
