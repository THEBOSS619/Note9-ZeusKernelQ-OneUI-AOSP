<h3 class="section">17.2 Everything about Instruction Patterns</h3>

<p><a name="index-patterns-3286"></a><a name="index-instruction-patterns-3287"></a>
<a name="index-define_005finsn-3288"></a>A <code>define_insn</code> expression is used to define instruction patterns
to which insns may be matched.  A <code>define_insn</code> expression contains
an incomplete RTL expression, with pieces to be filled in later, operand
constraints that restrict how the pieces can be filled in, and an output
template or C code to generate the assembler output.

 <p>A <code>define_insn</code> is an RTL expression containing four or five operands:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>An optional name <var>n</var>.  When a name is present, the compiler
automically generates a C++ function &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gen_</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo; that takes
the operands of the instruction as arguments and returns the instruction's
rtx pattern.  The compiler also assigns the instruction a unique code
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CODE_FOR_</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;, with all such codes belonging to an enum
called <code>insn_code</code>.

     <p>These names serve one of two purposes.  The first is to indicate that the
instruction performs a certain standard job for the RTL-generation
pass of the compiler, such as a move, an addition, or a conditional
jump.  The second is to help the target generate certain target-specific
operations, such as when implementing target-specific intrinsic functions.

     <p>It is better to prefix target-specific names with the name of the
target, to avoid any clash with current or future standard names.

     <p>The absence of a name is indicated by writing an empty string
where the name should go.  Nameless instruction patterns are never
used for generating RTL code, but they may permit several simpler insns
to be combined later on.

     <p>For the purpose of debugging the compiler, you may also specify a
name beginning with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; character.  Such a name is used only
for identifying the instruction in RTL dumps; it is equivalent to having
a nameless pattern for all other purposes.  Names beginning with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; character are not required to be unique.

     <p>The name may also have the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;.  This has the same
effect as a name &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;, but in addition tells the compiler to
generate further helper functions; see <a href="Parameterized-Names.html#Parameterized-Names">Parameterized Names</a> for details.

     <li>The <dfn>RTL template</dfn>: This is a vector of incomplete RTL expressions
which describe the semantics of the instruction (see <a href="RTL-Template.html#RTL-Template">RTL Template</a>). 
It is incomplete because it may contain <code>match_operand</code>,
<code>match_operator</code>, and <code>match_dup</code> expressions that stand for
operands of the instruction.

     <p>If the vector has multiple elements, the RTL template is treated as a
<code>parallel</code> expression.

     <li><a name="index-pattern-conditions-3289"></a><a name="index-conditions_002c-in-patterns-3290"></a>The condition: This is a string which contains a C expression.  When the
compiler attempts to match RTL against a pattern, the condition is
evaluated.  If the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, the match is
permitted.  The condition may be an empty string, which is treated
as always <code>true</code>.

     <p><a name="index-named-patterns-and-conditions-3291"></a>For a named pattern, the condition may not depend on the data in the
insn being matched, but only the target-machine-type flags.  The compiler
needs to test these conditions during initialization in order to learn
exactly which named instructions are available in a particular run.

     <p><a name="index-operands-3292"></a>For nameless patterns, the condition is applied only when matching an
individual insn, and only after the insn has matched the pattern's
recognition template.  The insn's operands may be found in the vector
<code>operands</code>.

     <p>An instruction condition cannot become more restrictive as compilation
progresses.  If the condition accepts a particular RTL instruction at
one stage of compilation, it must continue to accept that instruction
until the final pass.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!reload_completed</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">can_create_pseudo_p ()</span></samp>&rsquo; are both invalid instruction conditions,
because they are true during the earlier RTL passes and false during
the later ones.  For the same reason, if a condition accepts an
instruction before register allocation, it cannot later try to control
register allocation by excluding certain register or value combinations.

     <p>Although a condition cannot become more restrictive as compilation
progresses, the condition for a nameless pattern <em>can</em> become
more permissive.  For example, a nameless instruction can require
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">reload_completed</span></samp>&rsquo; to be true, in which case it only matches
after register allocation.

     <li>The <dfn>output template</dfn> or <dfn>output statement</dfn>: This is either
a string, or a fragment of C code which returns a string.

     <p>When simple substitution isn't general enough, you can specify a piece
of C code to compute the output.  See <a href="Output-Statement.html#Output-Statement">Output Statement</a>.

     <li>The <dfn>insn attributes</dfn>: This is an optional vector containing the values of
attributes for insns matching this pattern (see <a href="Insn-Attributes.html#Insn-Attributes">Insn Attributes</a>).
      </ol>
